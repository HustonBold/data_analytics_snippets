The overall flow should look like that

1. Getting data from HH or any other job board service
2. Formating and cleaning the data
3. Storing the data in my local DataBase (choose the one that is better/cheaper for individuals)
4. Manipulating data in python - scripts for analysis
5. Importing the final tables into Google sheets
6. Visualizing data in Tableau Public
